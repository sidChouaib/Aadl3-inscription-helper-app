# AADL3 Inscription Heloper App 🚀

Welcome! This flutter app is designed to streamline and automate the registration process for this housing website that opens for a few seconds every several hours and under very heavy loads of demand (Roughly 1 Million people registered in a week).

This app solves the problem for people that aren't constantly facing their computers checking the website using AutoReload browser extensions.

## Features 🌟

### Continuous Monitoring and Reloading 🔄
- **Persistent Monitoring**: The bot continuously reloads the target website every few seconds, ensuring that you never miss the brief registration window.
- **Visual Indication**: Stay informed with real-time visual feedback each time the website reloads.

### Automated Form Filling 📝
- **Efficient Data Entry**: Automatically fills out all necessary registration fields, excluding captcha.
- **Time-Saving**: Eliminate the hassle of manually entering information during the short registration periods.

### User Notifications 🔔
- **Instant Alerts**: Receive a notification sound as soon as the website becomes available, allowing you to quickly complete the captcha and submit your registration.

### WebView Integration 🌐
- **Seamless Browsing**: Leveraging `webview_flutter`, the app provides a seamless browsing experience within the app itself.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Enjoy smooth and responsive interactions with the target website.

## Future Improvements 📈
- **Captcha Solver Integration**: Exploring ways to automate captcha solving for a fully hands-free registration process.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Continuous improvements to the user interface for a more intuitive and seamless experience.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling to manage potential issues during the registration process.
